gphoto2 Build Scripts

This repository contains build scripts for specialized builds of libgphoto2 and gphoto2. Currently, there are two directories containing two different scripts:
* android: an Android port using the Android NDK cross compiler
* appimage: a standalone AppImage encapsulating dependencies plus camlibs/iolibs

DON'T INVOKE THE SCRIPTS DIRECTLY (or else you might mess up your host system). Instead, the scripts are designed to be run within a corresponding Docker/podman container that encapsulates the build environment. First build the container, then launch the container with a volume mount pointing to a host directory. Sources and build artifacts will appear there. You can find more detailed instructions in the README files in the above directories.

These scripts are licensed under the GPL unless otherwise stated. The projects and corresponding build artifacts are licensed separately.

Use these scripts at your own risk and inspect them thoroughly. While these scripts work for me, I bear no responsibility for any damage that may occur to your own devices.
